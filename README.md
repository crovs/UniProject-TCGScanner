## Prerequisites

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Quick Setup

1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TCGCardScanner
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Ximilar API** (Required for card grading):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Ximilar API token (see detailed setup below)
   ```

3. **Install iOS Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd ios && bundle install && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
   ```

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   # iOS
   npm run ios
   
   # Android
   npm run android
   ```

> üìã **Need Ximilar API access?** See the [detailed setup guide](#-ximilar-api-setup) below.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# üîë Ximilar API Setup

This app uses Ximilar's AI-powered card grading service to analyze TCG card conditions. To use the full functionality, you'll need to set up a Ximilar account and API token.

## Step 1: Create Ximilar Account

1. **Visit Ximilar Website**: Go to [https://app.ximilar.com](https://app.ximilar.com)

2. **Sign Up**: Click "Sign Up" and create a new account with:
   - Your email address
   - A secure password
   - Company/Organization name (can be personal)

3. **Verify Email**: Check your email and verify your account by clicking the verification link

4. **Choose Plan**: 
   - **Free Tier**: Includes limited API calls for testing
   - **Paid Plans**: For production use with higher limits
   - Start with the free tier to test the functionality

## Step 2: Access Card Grader API

1. **Login**: Sign in to your Ximilar dashboard at [https://app.ximilar.com](https://app.ximilar.com)

2. **Navigate to Card Grader**: 
   - In the left sidebar, look for "Card Grader" or "Products"
   - Click on "Card Grader" to access the card grading service

3. **Enable Service**: 
   - If this is your first time, you may need to enable the Card Grader service
   - Follow the setup wizard if prompted

## Step 3: Get Your API Token

1. **Go to API Settings**: 
   - In your Ximilar dashboard, navigate to "API" or "Settings"
   - Look for "API Keys" or "Authentication" section

2. **Generate Token**: 
   - Click "Generate New Token" or "Create API Key"
   - Give it a descriptive name like "TCG Card Scanner Mobile App"
   - Copy the generated token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

3. **Save Token Securely**: 
   - Store your API token in a secure location
   - Never share this token publicly or commit it to version control

## Step 4: Configure the App

1. **Copy Environment File**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit Environment Variables**:
   Open the `.env` file in your text editor and replace the placeholder:
   ```env
   # Environment Configuration for TCG Card Scanner
   # IMPORTANT: Never commit this file to version control

   # Ximilar API Configuration
   XIMILAR_API_TOKEN=your_actual_api_token_here
   XIMILAR_BASE_URL=https://api.ximilar.com/card-grader/v2

   # Development Configuration
   NODE_ENV=development
   DEBUG_MODE=true
   ```

3. **Replace the Token**:
   - Replace `your_actual_api_token_here` with your actual Ximilar API token
   - Save the file

## Step 5: Verify Setup

1. **Clean and Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   # Clean cache
   npx react-native start --reset-cache

   # For iOS
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   npx react-native run-ios

   # For Android
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

2. **Test API Connection**:
   - Open the app and navigate to the Scanner screen
   - Try scanning a card image
   - If configured correctly, you should see card grading results

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid API Token Error
- Double-check your API token in the `.env` file
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Verify the token is still active in your Ximilar dashboard

### Network Connection Issues
- Ensure your device/simulator has internet access
- Check if you're behind a corporate firewall
- Try the demo mode first to test app functionality

### API Rate Limits
- Free tier has limited API calls per month
- Monitor your usage in the Ximilar dashboard
- Consider upgrading to a paid plan for production use

### Environment Variables Not Loading
- Make sure the `.env` file is in the project root
- Restart Metro bundler after changing environment variables
- For iOS, clean and rebuild the project

## Demo Mode

If you want to test the app without setting up Ximilar immediately:

1. The app includes fallback demo data for testing
2. Card grading will show simulated results
3. All other features (collection, dark mode, etc.) work normally

## API Documentation

For more advanced usage and API details:
- [Ximilar Card Grader API Documentation](https://docs.ximilar.com/card-grader/)
- [API Rate Limits and Pricing](https://ximilar.com/pricing/)
- [Support and Contact](https://ximilar.com/contact/)

## Security Best Practices

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes**:

1. **Never commit your `.env` file to version control**
2. **Don't share your API token publicly**
3. **Regenerate your token if compromised**
4. **Use different tokens for development/production**
5. **Monitor API usage regularly**

The `.env` file is already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
